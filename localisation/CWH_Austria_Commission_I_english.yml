  ## USA Commission
  USA_commission:0 "Phase 1 of the Commission"
  USA_electoral_college_desc:0 "The first Tuesday of November, a day of jubilee for some, where proud patriots march out into the streets and vocalize their view of how the country should be managed. For others, the first Tuesday is a day to be dreaded, a day where after a long day of work a man comes home to hear a snake-tongued politician sell himself to his community. Regardless, on March fourth one man will bow out of the White House and one will enter, ready to pursue the agenda of his party. As the American people cast their ballots, one of four parties will see their vision for the nation come to fruition. Resonating with the traditionalist voters of America, the platform of the Democratic Party is the oldest in American politics, dating back to the foundation of the Democratic-Republican party from a joint effort between Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. During the Era of Good Feelings, where the Democratic-Republican party was the only political organization in the United States, the Democratic party's influence was immeasurable, which can still be seen to this day with the talking points of the party extending into the Whig party and the eventual Republican party, following the 1828 split between Andrew Jackson and James Monroe. The Era of Good Feelings ended abruptly with the rise of the Whig party, lead by Henry Clay. Taking a firm stance as the anti-slavery party, the Whigs distinguished themselves from the Democratic-Republicans during the 1850 election. The big tent of abolitionists making a home in the Whig party did not agree on all issues, despite their common goal. The election of 1896 saw the Whigs splinter off for good, with Theodore Roosevelt taking the left wing of the party with him to found the Progressive Party. The radical left of the Whig's did not find their home in the newly minted Progressive party, but rather in the newly reorganized Republican-Labor Party, rallying around the teachings of German-American thinker Karl Marx. As election day rolls around once again, time will only tell if the Democrats will maintain the status-quo, if the Whigs will further their abolitionist agenda, if Teddy's party can enact the wide reaching reform that builds the foundation of their party, or even if the Republican-Laborists can sweep the nation out from beneath the feet of the other three.\n\nThe §BDemocratic§!
