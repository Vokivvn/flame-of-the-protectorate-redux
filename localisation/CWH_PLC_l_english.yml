introeventsPLC.1.t:0 "The Road North"
introeventsPLC.1.d:0 "The revolution has come to Poland! Like so many before, the common folk of an antiquated monarchy have risen up and thrown off the chains of oppression, establishing a Republic in which the matters of government and administration are a matter of the people, not of a rich autocrat born into their position! In mere days, the republican movement spread like wildfire across Poland, forcing the cowardly royal family to retreat to their other primary possession, Lithuania.\n\nThe road to liberation still lies ahead of the people of the Commonwealth. The monarchy continues to try and stomp out the flames of revolt, hiding in the north of the empire and commanding what remains of the loyalist army scattered across the formerly united bastion of the east. Nationalists have taken advantage of the chaos to betray the united front, abandoning the united anti-monarchist union to strike out on their own. Their people have been misled by power-hungry nationalists, and it is the duty of the republican front to save them from both the broken monarchy and from opportunistic separatists. The republican dream is not yet lost!"
introeventsPLC.1.a:0 "Forwards for revolution!"

introeventsPLC.2.t:0 "Our Shrinking Grip"
introeventsPLC.2.d:0 "The worst has come to pass. In the closing months of 1935, traitorous republican forces launched a united uprising against the Commonwealth, slaughtering nobles and seizing government buildings and forts. The young King Michael II was forced to flee to Lithuania with the royal family, the boy of only fifteen completely unprepared for a revolt such as this. Still, in these hard times, he has stepped up, refusing to back down and commanding the army to fight back.\n\nThe odds are stacked against the monarchy. Republican forces hold the largest portion of the former empire, and armies loyal to the king are scattered and isolated throughout the garrisons they managed to hold. Separatists raise their bloody flags, using war to further their backstabbing causes. To the east and south, ravenous powers seek to capitalize on the conflict and expand their already-bloated realms. Through all this, the king must hold strong. He must fight to save his family, his future, and his nation."
introeventsPLC.2.a:0 "The King shall prevail!"

introeventsPLC.3.t:0 "Long Live Belarus!"
introeventsPLC.3.d:0 "The flames of war rage around Belarus, giving its people the first true chance for freedom in centuries. For hundreds of years, the people of Ruthenia have toiled under a so-called "Commonwealth" that in reality acts against their interests, using them only to build the wealth of rich aristocrats from Poland and Lithuania. The Belarusian people are often not even recognized for what they are, a unique and independent people with their own tradition and heritage, and are instead unjustly grouped in with other ethnic groups as to erase their identity. No more. Belarus stands free and proud!"
introeventsPLC.3.a:0 "We will never surrender our freedom!"

introeventsPLC.4.t:0 "Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!"
introeventsPLC.4.d:0 "Ukraine finally flies her flag, free and proud! In the initial stages of the revolt against the monarchy, Field Hetman of Poland Pavlo Skoropadskyi held true to the King, commanding royal armies to crush republican uprising. However, as the revolution quickly grew out of hand, Skoropadskyi made the decision to return to his home of Ukraine and fight not for the king but for his homeland. He was made Hetman of Ukraine, and with his military expertise and keen instincts it seemed clear that he would deal a major blow to any foe that would try and resubjugate his proud homeland. Unfortunately, the enemy now came from within.\n\nJust as Ukraine declared itself independent from the collapsing nation that surrounded it, it too fell into chaos as Marxist revolutionary Lev Bronstein rose up with his red armies. The Hetman now struggles not only against Poland and Lithuania but against the workers' armies that threaten to dismantle his beloved home and fly the red flag where the Ukrainian colors should rightfully stand. With foes on all sides, the Hetman faces perhaps the greatest challenge of any in the war."
introeventsPLC.4.a:0 "For Ukraine!"

introeventsPLC.5.t:0 "Revolutions Are Always Verbose"
introeventsPLC.5.d:0 "The uprising in Poland is no true revolution. It is the common worker being manipulated into serving a new upper class, one that is just as corrupt and oppressive as the monarchy but channels the laborer's rage against inequality towards a single target: the King. This single minded hatred of the monarchy while simultaneously ignoring the true roots of the problem is the eternal flaw with republicanism, and it is why another way must be embraced, one where the worker rules himself and is oppressed by none. This is the vision of Lev Bronstein, not just for his own Ukraine, but for the entirety of the Commonwealth, and someday for the world.\n\nBronstein's uprising in Ukraine challenges the Hetmanate under Skoropadskyi, but in his plans it will come to challenge the entire realm. The workers of all four constituent nations must be liberated, and once Ukraine is saved Bronstein may push to save them all. Only in the chaos of a war like this does he have a chance. The true revolution must prevail, lest the farce led by the anti-monarchists chain the workers again for another three centuries."
introeventsPLC.5.a:0 "Workers of the world, unite!"
