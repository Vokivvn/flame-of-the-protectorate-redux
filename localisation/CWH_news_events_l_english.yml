newswar.3.desc:0 "What began as a number of limited military actions between the fledging states of the South African Republic and the Free State of Orange has spiraled out into a full war in the region as the small nations of Southern Africa prepare for war. As ideological tensions between the two Boer republics grew, Boers in the Natalian exclave of Vryheid declared independence from the Natalia Republic, a small multiethnic state that has recently left a brutal revolution. The unrecognized Vryheid Free State has declared its intent to join the South African Republic, but clashes between the new republic and the Kingdom of Zulu has brought both it and the Natalia Republic to war with Zulu shortly before the South African Republic attacked Zulu and the Natalia Republic to defend Vryheid."

newswar.4.t:0 "Civil War Breaks Out in France"
newswar.4.desc:0 "The French Republic has once again spiralled into chaos, with the revelation that many Socialists were locked out of government due to corrupt bargains. In a sweeping investigation, the Gendarmerie Nationale have indicted several electoral officials on charges of corruption. Not even the Cabinet was spared, as police began to raid the homes of the Defense Minister and Prime Minister on the heels of a perceived ring dedicated to locking the Socialists out of government.\n\nOutraged, the leader of the Socialists, Édouard Herriot has called for revolution against the regime, declaring that “Reformism is truly dead, as long as the capitalist tyrants keep us out of power. The time is now, proletarians of France!”, and many have already heeded the call: arsenals, barracks, town halls, and factories have been seized nationwide by defecting soldiers and furious workers.\n\nThe army has already responded to this call with hot lead and cold steel, mobilizing all available reserves with orders to shoot live ammunition. President Gamelin has already made his intentions clear as Commander-in-Chief; there is no negotiating with forces subversive to democracy and anathemic to due process. The situation has continued to devolve into an all-out state of civil war, with many already speculating as to how history will be impacted by this bloodshed."
