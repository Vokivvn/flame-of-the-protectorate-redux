 centralism:0 "Revisionism"
 centralism_noun:0 "Revisionist"
 centralism_desc:0 "Revisionist Government"
 centralism_subtype_desc:0 "§WRevisionism§!\n\nWhile adhering to the teachings of several prominent left wing theorists, revisionists take the original ideal and mold it into their own image. The empowered workers of revisionist states cry out, demanding the means to forge their own path, a path of evolutionary change not revolution, a path of corporation not of senseless violence. Firm believers that equality cannot be reached by waging war against a class of people, the soft approach of the revisionists seek to ally with the bourgeois to achieve their end goal."
 blanquism:0 "Blanquism"
 blanquism_desc:0 "§WBlanquism§!\n\nNo leftist dares step out of the boundaries of the core values shared across the board, that of liberation and delivering power from the top down, that is, of course, excluding the followers of French political theorist Louis Auguste Blanqui. Blanquists view the popular revolution as that of chaos, of disorganized groups of laborers who will be easily defeated by the upper class which has provoked the ire of much of the left, causing a schism between the already fractured ideology. Instead, Blaqui teaches that a small group of intellectuals should lead the nation into revolution. After achieving power, the clique who guided the right arm of liberation will establish a temporary dictatorship to safeguard the fresh state before devolving power back to the people."
 social_nationalism:0 "Social Nationalism"
 social_nationalism_desc:0 "§WSocial Nationalism§!\n\nAn amalgamation of left right and center, social nationalism blends in the anti-immigration and takes up arms for a homogenous state, while also standing for rule of the people, just so long as they are the right ones. Firecly against imperalism in any shape or form, socal nationalists despise the upper class that has forced the strongest people into slavery and exploitation. Imperialism isn't the only enemy, never would a proud citizen dare adhere to the internationalist view plaguing most of the left."
 bordigism:0 "Bordigism"
 bordigism_desc:0 "§WBordigism§!\n\nThe decadence of capitalism infested all forms of government, democracy has become a rally point for the bourgeois to vex the common worker out of having absolute power. Reactionary elements have long since openly used the democratic system as their own playground, free to put up thin veils of Engelism or Leninism to keep the oppressed distracted with figureheads and romantic heroes to show them progress is being made and that no uprising is necessary. For once, the bourgeoisie are correct, there is no need for uprising, for the organization of the working man under one banner, as history has proven that the influence of the upper class wanes as the moon. The revolutionary thought of Amadeo Bordiga has come under fire from all sides, namely the doctrine of worker autonomy, only proving that the bourgeoisie is still in power even in red states."
 leninism:0 "Leninism"
 leninism_desc:0 "§WLeninism§!\n\nThe proletariat must be guided towards building a proper socialist society and then the apparatus of the state will simply fade, said the Swiss-Russian Engelist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin. Leninism advocates for the creation of a one-party socialist state that will eventually "wither away" into a society that is truly classless with complete worker-controlled means of production. Standing vehemently opposed to right wing and event center-left ideology, Leninism supports a state planned economy as well as unity around a vanguard party to guide the proletariat."
 
 socialism:0 "Socialism"
 socialism_noun:0 "Socialist"
 socialism_desc:0 "Socialist Government"
 socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§WSocialism§!\n\nSocialism is an incredibly broad term that roughly means advocating to solve various problems related to labor through collective control of economic production. Many different socialist thinkers advocate for a variety of beliefs regarding how socialism should be implemented and what it will even look like. At the core of global socialism is the International Workingmen's Association, also known as the International, which is made up of socialist and anarchist organizations throughout the world that advocate for the downfall of the capitalist order and the establishment of a fair and equal socialist society."
 de_leonism:0 "Marxism-De Leonism"
 de_leonism_desc:0 "§WMarxist-De Leonism§!\n\nDe Leonism breaks from the Syndicalists and the Demoratic socialists by forging a two prong attack against the bourgeoisie. Firstly, large scale union projects and then the foundation of a socalist party, which when a sufficient mandate is achieved, will hand control over factories, farms, and mines to worker's councils. De Leonism completely blocks out the ruling class by beating them on the assembly line and in the halls of government."
 engelism:0 "Engelism"
 engelism_desc:0 "§WEngelism§!\n\nThe jump from capitalist to communist is simply too much in the eyes of followers of Friedrich Engels. Instead, scientific socialism advocates for the creation of a socalist state that will eventually achieve a truly classless system with total control of the means of production by the workers. Standing vehemently opposed to right wing and event center-left ideology, Engelism supports a state planned economy as well as the exploration of the revolution."
 anarchism:0 "Anarchism"
 anarchism_desc:0 "§WAnarchism§!\n\nRejecting hierarchy in all forms, from God, to king, to prime minister, anarchists take great influence from the works of Mikhail Bakunin. The defining trait of anarchism is that of liberty, not token concessions or half measures, but total and absolute emancipation of the people. Largely opposed to all other forms of government, anarchists despise the authoritarian wings of the left and right, embodying the values of dictatorship regardless of intentions."
 utopian_socialism:0 "Utopian Socialism"
 utopian_socialism_desc:0 "§WUtopian Socialism§!\n\nAt a glance, utopian socialism may spark ideas of a grand future of global peace and a world free of suffering but the roots of utopian socialism are grounded firmly in reality. Ultimately, utopian socialists aim to create a just and rational society as an end goal for human society, finally achieving utopia when a state is based on sensible legislation and takes part in no unjust activity. Utopians break ranks with other leftists, even anarchists, in their belief that there is no class struggle necessary for socialism to emerge."
 liberal_socialism:0 "Liberal Socialism"
 liberal_socialism_desc:0 "§WLiberal Socialism§!\n\nThough often compared to democratic socialism, liberal socialists take aspects of progressive liberalism, such as a mixed economy of state and private ownership, and combine it with socalist social policy of liberation and social justice. It considers both liberty and equality to be compatible and mutually dependent on each other."
 
 bundism:0 "Bundism"
 bundism_desc:0 "§WBundism§!"
 
 progressivism:0 "Progressivism"
 progressivism_noun:0 "Progressive"
 progressivism_desc:0 "Progressive Government"
 progressivism_subtype_desc:0 "§WProgressivism§!\n\nTo progressives, conservatives wear rose tinted glasses when viewing the past, picking out the times where tradition brought success and ignoring when it shackled men in slavery. Progressives look back at history and see a growing trend of cooperation and the removal of arbitrary boundaries. Working together has catapulted humanity into the modern age and so to keep flying towards the future, everyone from the poorest laborer to the richest suit must stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity."
 social_democracy:0 "Social Democracy"
 social_democracy_desc:0 "§WSocial Democracy§!\n\nUniting around the call for bread and roses, the progressive states who have opened the halls of government for the common worker carefully balance maintaining a competitive economic framework and building a safety net to catch the most vulnerable."
 democratic_socialism:0 "Democratic Socialism"
 democratic_socialism_desc:0 "§WDemocratic Socialism§!\n\nDemocratic socialism is an ideology that looks towards the welfare of the masses, while largely renouncing the revolutionary doctrine and class analysis of Marxism in favour of a strong, democratic state apparatus to enact economic reforms such as welfare programs and nationalization of capital."
 liberal_reformer:0 "Liberal Reformism"
 liberal_reformer_desc:0 "§WLiberal Reformism§!\n\nToeing the fine line between social liberalism and social democracy, liberal reformers staunchly believe in the free market, but think every good system comes with its flaws. Pushing the envelope on social issues, reformists focus on building a welfare state capable of defending everyone from top to bottom of the class structure."
 
 liberalism:0 "Liberalism"
 liberalism_noun:0 "Liberal"
 liberalism_desc:0 "Liberal Government"
 liberalism_subtype_desc:0 "§WLiberalism§!\n\nWhat is more important than freedom? The freedom to participate in democracy, freedom to speak openly, the freedom to sleep soundly at night knowing the government is ready and willing to defend the rights of the commoner at the drop of a hat. However, personal freedoms can also be squashed if they do not have access to the market, and thus liberals believe that the rights of man and of business are conjoined at the hip."
 classical_liberalism:0 "Classical Liberalism"
 classical_liberalism_desc:0 "§WClassical Liberalism§!\n\nBlending together freedom of the market with the rights of the individual, classical liberals believe in a minimalist approach to government, keep the government in it's lane and carefully guard any expansion of the state. As a servant to the people, the government must hold the rights of citizens paramount and defend them at a moment's notice. They seek to empower the commercial class politically, to abolish monopolies, and increase productive efficiency. Using peace as a tool, classical liberals justify intervention on the grounds that democracy and laissez-faire economics diminishes the frequency of war."
 social_liberalism:0 "Social Liberalism"
 social_liberalism_desc:0 "§WSocial Liberalism§!\n\nSocially liberal nations draw contrast from their classical cousins in regards to the size and goals of the state. While classical liberals may support the small state for the purposes of maintaining rights, social liberals demand a state that expands the rights of man and tackles it's most pressing issues. Focusing on minimizing the effects of unemployment, hunger, and homelessness, social liberals maintain a capitalist system while tackling the biggest issues facing the nation."
 federalism:0 "Federalism"
 federalism_desc:0 "§WFederalism§!\n\nThe constituent must share power with the government, as they provide the mandate  to govern, and as such, disagreements often arise before local and federal authorities. To balance the harmony of the nation, federalism focuses on the separation of powers. The right of the individual to be represented by their sub-division when the state fails is the hallmark of federalist ideology."
 
 conservatism:0 "Conservatism"
 conservatism_noun:0 "Conservative"
 conservatism_desc:0 "Conservative Government"
 conservatism_subtype_desc:0 "§WConservatism§!\n\nStaying true to traditional values, conservative states believe that the last centuries of progress and innovation have shown that something was being done right and it would be unwise to stray off the beaten path. Despite the old ways being held in high standing, conservatives do not default to monarchs, rather believing in properly functioning democracy with ballots cast based on tradition, not untested policies."
 fiscal_conservatism:0 "Fiscal Conservatism"
 fiscal_conservatism_desc:0 "§WFiscal Conservatism§!\n\nBelieving in a healthy blend of both sides, fiscally minded nations prioritize the free market to guide the nation to prosperity, while occasionally offering concessions to the left. Above all else, the budget must be watched carefully and only allocated to the right place at the right time, while keeping taxes low and programs kept to the bare essentials so as to provide for the people both in their wallets and in their homes."
 social_conservatism:0 "Social Conservatism"
 social_conservatism_desc:0 "§WSocial Conservatism§!\n\nSwerving to the right of their brothers in the center, social conservatism is often based in religious traditions, but being religious is not a prerequisite for being socially conservative. For most, conservatism can be summed up as the adherence to the old ways, harkening back to historical beliefs on social issues."
 christian_democracy:0 "Christian Democracy"
 christian_democracy_desc:0 "§WChristian Democracy§!\n\nTypically, democracy and religion go together like oil and water, the foundation of democratic states is built on the pedestal of freedom, including freedom of religion. However, the state does not have to be Christian for the values of Christ to be expressed by the ballot. Opposing socalist and unionist movements, Christian democrats swing to the right on most issues, but also incorporate environmentalist ideals from the left."
 
 republicanism:0 "Republicanism"
 republicanism_noun:0 "Republican"
 republicanism_desc:0 "Republican Government"
 republicanism_subtype_desc:0 "§WRepublicanism§!\n\nMany groups make their home in the big tent of republicanism, from oligarchs, to populists, to democrats. The common denominator in these nations is the steadfast belief there should not be sole rule. Even if not all are able to participate in the republic, it is a republic no less."
 revolutionary_regime:0 "Revolutionary Regime"
 revolutionary_regime_desc:0 "§WRevolutionary Regime§!\n\n"Down with the old order," shout the firebrand orators of the populist revolution, "death to the status quo!" Coming to power by violent and extrajudicial means, those in the leagues of revolutionary states make a name for themselves as the bulwark of a broken system of governance."
 authoritarian_democracy:0 "Authoritarian Democracy"
 authoritarian_democracy_desc:0 "§WAuthoritarian Democracy§!\n\nBeing vested with the power to guide the nation comes at a price, only those who earn their place in it deserve to take the helm and steer the country to greatness. Utilizing the democratic system to hinder targeted groups from participating in it via poll taxes, literacy tests, and delicately crafting the voting process to make it as complex and incasseabile as possible, authoritarian democracies maintain the illusion of a free democracy, only with numerous asterisks on who get to participate."
 democracy_of_the_few:0 "Democracy of the Few"
 democracy_of_the_few_desc:0 "§WDemocracy of the Few§!\n\nDemocracy as the apparatus of the state has run its course. Initially envisioned as a gift to the people, a means to make their own decisions, history has shown that mobs cannot be trusted with such important matters. No man should rule alone but no mob should rule a man. To keep the state smooth and profitable, a small council of leading figures will ensure that the decisions made are carefully calculated, but above all, correct."
 
 authoritarianism:0 "Authoritarianism"
 authoritarianism_noun:0 "Authoritarian"
 authoritarianism_desc:0 "Authoritarian Government"
 authoritarianism_subtype_desc:0 "§WAuthoritarianism§!\n\nFor most of human civilization, one man rules and the others listen. Doing so prevents squabbling for power and making uninformed decisions, but so seems to be the tide of the zeitgeist. More and more, nations decentralize and grant power to men without thousands of years of prestigious lineage to back them up. Authoritarian nations believe that authority is paramount to success for without it, anarchy reigns."
 colonial_government:0 "Colonial Government"
 colonial_government_desc:0 "§WColonial Government§!\n\nConquered, pillaged, and plundered, world spanning empires in their quest to bring civilization to the far flung corners of the world have irreversibly changed the course of the land. Attempting to usher in a foreign culture into a region diverse in its local tribes and communities is simply a burden too much to bear for the mother nation. So enters the colonial government, specifically crafted to keep the profits flowing and squash any notion of independence."
 despotism:0 "Despotism"
 despotism_desc:0 "§WDespotism§!\n\nRipping apart the status quo, the opportunistic, power hungry of the world show that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Despots disregard the velvet glove in favor of the iron fist. The timultus climb to the plattu of power has taught them one thing, snakes slither in every nook and cranny of government. The despot looks at the world in simple terms, there are enemies and there are tools, ruling is a balancing act between keeping the enemies few and the tools in check."
 absolutism:0 "Absolutism"
 absolutism_desc:0 "§WAbsolutism§!\n\nTracing back to the ancient kingdoms of Europe, the land was not property of the people who toiled it's soil, but of the king alone, chosen by God alone to exercise his will over the world. The monarch owns the land, they ought to have full control of it. The state is the monarch, the laborers are an extension of the monarch, and ultimately, the monarch is a tool of the divine."
 
 ultranationalism:0 "Ultranationalism"
 ultranationalism_noun:0 "Ultranationalist"
 ultranationalism_desc:0 "Ultranationalist Government"
 ultranationalism_subtype_desc:0 "§WUltranationalism§!\n\nLive and die for the state. Ultranationalists believe one thing, the nation is the land of the greatest people with the most rich and awe-inspiring culture. Life must be devoted into the strengthening of the state, no matter how many years are spent with choked lungs in factories, no matter how many children's hands must be calloused from nurturing the crops, no matter who must die, all that matters is the survival and expansion of the most powerful state."
 corporatism:0 "Corporatism"
 corporatism_desc:0 "§WCorporatism§!\n\nWhat happens when you combine the special interests of corporations with the organs of society? The definition of a nation is altered at its core. The ballot traded for the boardroom, young men sent into battle not at the behest of the nation whom they pledge to defend but rather at the whim of the corporate conglomerates. Corporatism revolves around breaking the boundaries that divided business and state and combining them into one."
 ethnic_nationalism:0 "Etnnic Nationalism"
 ethnic_nationalism_desc:0 "§WEthnic Nationalism§!\n\nEnsuring the common ancestry of the people above all else, the fiercely nationalist subscribers of the ancient works of Herodotitus believe that the nation should consist solely of similar culture groups. The few within the borders of these states who adhere to different traditions will be gradually urged to abandon their heritage for that of the majority."
 national_syndicalism:0 "National Syndicalism"
 national_syndicalism_desc:0 "§WNational Syndicalism§!\n\nWhat makes a nation? In the eyes of national syndicalists, order, reason, classicism, authority and liberty are the building blocks to the success of the state. Society must be orderly to function and for society to function the laws must be reasonable, not hedonistic and destructive. The modern school of thought has failed, with every passing day the values that brought the world to greatness, that of Auguste Comte and Thomas Aquinas, are disregarded for secularism and liberal governments."
