  DEN.1.t:0 "The Norwegian Revolution"
  DEN.1.d:0 "In Christiania, the Danish flag flies high.\n\nIn Bergen, the Danish flag burns.\n\nThe worst has come to pass. After months of rising tensions and threats from Norwegian nationalist groups, an uprising has finally begun. Siezing the city of Bergen, noted Norwegian nationalist and anti-monarchist Karl Meyer announced to Norway and the world via radio broadcast that the Norwegian people would be subjects of Denmark no longer. The broadcast was the perfect cue for nationalist groups across the north to take action, and within the day much of the country had been seized. In Oslo itself, gunfire between separatists and the military lasted for hours, but eventually the Danish garrison prevailed. However, Norway is already on the march, and they will not rest until the entirety of their nation is liberated.\n\nMany generals and senior government officials are wondering how the Norwegian revolutionaries managed to rally so quickly and where all their weapons are coming from. Though it is unwise to listen to rumors, there are dark whispers that the Protectorate is behind this revolt. Given Meyer's anti-monarchist tendencies and Britain's eternal quest to increase its influence, the rumor may unfortunately hold weight. All that Denmark can do now is fight back like it has never fought before."
